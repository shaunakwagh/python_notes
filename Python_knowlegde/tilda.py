"""
This code demonstrates the use of the bitwise NOT operator (~) in Python.

When used as an operator, the tilde symbol in Python represents
the bitwise complement or bitwise NOT operator.
This operator inverts the bits of an integer.
When applied to a number x, the result is -(x + 1)

x = 5
result = ~x
print(result) # Output: -6
