# Chapter 1: The Python Data Model


- **Python Data Model**: A framework that defines how objects behave in Python. It consists of a set of special methods (also called “dunder” or “magic” methods) that allow objects to integrate seamlessly with Python’s built-in features like iteration, operator overloading, and attribute access.

Magic method is slang for Special Methods

"Dunder" is a shortcut for "double underscore before and after."


Special methods are meant to be called by the python interpreter, and not by you.
